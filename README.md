# threejs-boids

My attempt at GPU-rendered boids <strike>without looking at examples</strike>
using my old boids simulation code as much as possible.

Use of GPUComputationRenderer and some tricks ripped from this threejs example
https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_gpgpu_birds.html

## Concepts Demonstrated

  - Boids flocking algorithm
  - GPUComputationalRender for boids algorithms in gpu
  - Skybox for sky

## Running

> nr build
> open dist/index.html

## Developing

> nr start

## TODO

  - Predator
  - Procedural terrain
  - Collision avoidance with terrain solids
